# Superior Ballistics — published build

The public build of the emafd external-ballistics solver, served at
**[ballistics.emafd.com](https://ballistics.emafd.com/)**.

This repository holds the deployed artefact and nothing else. `index.html` is
the entire application in one self-contained file: no build step, no framework,
no CDN, and no network requests at all once it has loaded. It also runs from
`file://`, so a copy on a phone or a USB stick works where there is no signal.

## This build

The build stamp is at the bottom of the page. Quote it when reporting anything,
otherwise there is no way to tell whether you were looking at a build that has
already been fixed.

The file must not be reformatted, minified, or passed through any optimiser. It
carries CRLF line endings and `.gitattributes` marks it `-text` so Git leaves
them alone; normalising them would not change how the solver runs, but it would
invalidate the hash above.

## Validation

The engine is a port of the Python solver it was derived from, and is checked
against it rather than trusted:

- **22 of 22** cross-validation cases pass per cell across the whole range
  card. The canonical 7.62 mm M852 168 gr reference reads −1357.3097 cm of drop
  at 1000 m, a deviation of 1.72e-5 cm against a 0.02 cm tripwire.
- Numeric primitives — every drag table and spline — are **bit-identical to
  SciPy**, 0 ULP.

## Scope

Superior Ballistics is an engineering-analysis and research tool, published for
numerical study, model comparison and validation work. It is not an operational
aid, and every result should be verified against measured data before it is
relied upon.
